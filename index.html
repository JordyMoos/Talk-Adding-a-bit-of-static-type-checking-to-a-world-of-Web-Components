						The way that it works is that you specify the behaviour of your API in a DSL like this<br>
						Here we just specify which "Interactions" need to happen and what "Events" they need or produce.<br>
						It is then to baker to determine that the Interactions happen in the correct order. Even in parallel if it can.<br>
						This gets rid of the most complex part of writing large workflows and that is the orchestration.
						You now just need to write the interactions independently which makes it much easier.

						But maybe the coolest part about Baker is, that the same DSL that runs your workflow. Can also be visualized into some sort of graph.<br>

						A function is a function as in JavaScript. You might give it a name. But essentially you specify which arguments it need and it will give you something back<br>
						You do not have `Methods` in Elm. Like you have in JavaScript. Elm does not have objects and therefor you neither have Methods on objects.<br>
						The biggest win is that you never have to worry what `this` actually means. Because there is no `this`.
